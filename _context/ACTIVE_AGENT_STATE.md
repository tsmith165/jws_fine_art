# Active Agent State

- Objective: finish the July 23 landing-page regression fixes requested after
  continuing session `019f3504-d23b-7733-8e30-681f2c981fae`.
- Workspace: `/Users/tsmith/dev/_codex/jws-fine-art`
- Branch: `feat/full-site-overhaul`
- Starting source commit: `4345f60`
- Completed source commit: `cdf66c2`
- Full handoff: `_context/PROJECT_HANDOFF.md`
- Session reconstruction: `_context/SESSION_CONTINUATION_019F3504.md`
- Production: `https://jwsfineart.com`
- Convex production: `https://hushed-crane-268.convex.cloud`
- Data safety: Convex is active; Neon remains a read-only backup.

## Current Change

- Fixed the collection-card black gutters by limiting the absolute label rule to
  `.lw-collection-card-label`; it had also matched the progressive-image wrapper
  and inset the artwork by `24px 24px 22px`.
- Restored first-slide reveal by withholding `is-revealed` until the progressive
  image reports ready. Added a nine-second subtle Ken Burns animation to revealed
  current and incoming hero images.
- Removed the five-artwork limit from the public query, server read, carousel,
  owner read/mutation, and `/admin/homepage`. The dot rail now scrolls for long
  rotations.
- Added a Convex test proving six artworks can be published and returned.

## Verification And Deployment

- Formatting, typecheck, lint, focused tests, and the full 76-test suite passed
  before continuation.
- Production Convex and the configured development Convex deployment were
  updated successfully on July 23, 2026.
- A production Next.js build passed under Node `v24.18.0`.
- Commits `7b5c6a9` and `cdf66c2` were pushed to
  `origin/feat/full-site-overhaul`.
- Vercel production deployment `dpl_Hqv9GXok1MFmhF4ViQJWqFtfSYs7` is ready and
  aliased to `https://www.jwsfineart.com`.
- Desktop `1440 × 1000` and mobile `390 × 844` browser QA passed. Collection
  wrapper gaps measured `0px` on every edge, the first hero transitioned from
  opacity `0` to `1`, its nine-second Ken Burns transform advanced over time,
  and neither breakpoint had horizontal page overflow.
- Authenticated `/admin/homepage` QA added a sixth artwork in unsaved client
  state, observed `6 selected` with Publish enabled, then reloaded without
  publishing. Production data was not changed.
- Detailed evidence: `_context/landing-regressions-production-qa.md`.
- Artifact aliases:
  `collection-card-borders-fixed-production-desktop`,
  `collection-card-borders-fixed-production-mobile`,
  `hero-motion-fixed-production-desktop`, and
  `hero-motion-fixed-production-mobile`.
- Artifact validation passed with 44 design artifacts, 62 preview QA artifacts,
  and 17 analysis records. The temporary browser viewport was reset and the
  browser session was finalized.
- Completion gate: commit this final state update, push it, and confirm the
  worktree is clean.

## Known Separate Risk

- Production Clerk emits a development-key warning. Fixing that requires the
  intended Clerk production instance/keys plus coordinated Convex issuer and
  Vercel configuration. Never record key values.
